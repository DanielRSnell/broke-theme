        "When building projects, going from an idea to a working version is
        crucial. Broke.dev's components have been extremely useful for quickly
        mocking up a landing page. I can now focus more time on my app, and less
        time worrying about the first impression my project will get. I really
        love the attention to detail in these blocks. Michael has always
        impressed me with the quality he produces."
