            Broke Componentsis legally required to complete what is called a KYC
            (Know Your Customer) Survey for every user that signs up, which
            includes completing identity verification for the person who chooses
            to be the owner, administrator, and representative of a Broke
            Componentsaccount. These requirements are intended to promote
            transparency and prevent individuals from using complex company
            structures to hide terrorist financing, money laundering, tax
            evasion, and other financial crimes. Usually, we are able to verify
            our users' identities automatically, but once in a while we are
            unable to and have to reach out for more information.

            Why has Broke Componentsplaced a reserve on my new account?

            Reserves are utilized to keep processing volume available within
            your Broke Componentsaccount to fund refunds or chargebacks. There
            are several possible reasons a reserve may be placed at onboarding.
            It could be that your business operates in an industry or with a
            business model that potentially creates additional credit risk, even
            if you are not yet receiving chargebacks. Some businesses may also
            collect payment far in advance, creating additional risk. Most
            reserves are temporary, however, and we are happy to revisit if you
            provide additional information by replying to the notification email
            you received.
